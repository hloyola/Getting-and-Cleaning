Getting-and-Cleaning
====================

Script for Getting and Cleaning data project

On the script I try to explain each step as clear as possibly. All started with the download of the compressed file
and as can you see all steps needed to finish with the writting of a file submitted.

There was a need of transform the names of the original names of variables availables before getting the average by
activity and subject. This is done because the strings "mean" and "()" interfered with the apply of the function to get the average requested.
