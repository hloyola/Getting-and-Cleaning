On this project, data is analyzed from measurement performed on a group of 30 subjects wearing an smartphone at the waist.
Details can be found at "http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones".

In short, all the features selected to conform the database came from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals
that are generated on one smartphone. These reading are named, tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ, respectivelly.

Post process gave origin to the "Jerk signals"(tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). 
Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm
(tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag).
Another post process, also, gave origin to fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag,
fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag.

And are these post processed variables that originate the working file in this project.

The submmited data file is a secondary process on the mean and standard deviations variables present on the post
processed file.

Each record in the "tidydat.txt" dataset provide the mean value for each combination of activity 
and subjects as described on the URL above.
